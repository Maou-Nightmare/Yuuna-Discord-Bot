# Yuuna-Discord-Bot
This is all the given Code of Yuuna-chan! Use this as a template for creating your own discord bot. Each File consists of atleast the basics of building your own Discord bot
using Nextcord/Discord.py

Notice: I am currently using the fork for discord.py which is nextcord. Where there is nextcord, please replace it with discord if using discord.py

Notice2: discord.py will be shutting down soon so I suggest that you switch to a forked version of discord.py which can either be; nextcord or pycord.
